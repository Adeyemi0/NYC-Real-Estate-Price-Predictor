## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes **18,177 NYC properties** scraped from Zillow, performing extensive data cleaning and feature engineering to build accurate price prediction models. After rigorous preprocessing, the final dataset contains **17,866 properties** with **20 features**.

### Key Highlights
- **Data Source**: Zillow (NYC Properties)
- **Models Trained**: LightGBM, CatBoost, ExtraTrees
- **Best Model**: LightGBM (MAPE: 30.72%, R¬≤: 0.7992)
- **Features**: 10 carefully engineered features from street patterns, location, and property characteristics
- **Deployment**: LightGBM model deployed on HuggingFace Spaces

## üìÅ Dataset Information

### Initial Data Structure
```
Shape: (18,177, 19)
Boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island
Property Types: Houses, Condos, Apartments, Townhouses
```

### Features
- **Location**: Address, zipcode, borough, latitude, longitude
- **Property Details**: Bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, home type
- **Pricing**: Price, date of price change
- **Metadata**: ZPID, listing type, images, Zillow URL

## üßπ Data Cleaning Pipeline

### 1. Street Name Extraction
Cleaned street addresses by removing:
- Unit/apartment numbers (#, APT, UNIT, SUITE)
- Building numbers
- Floor designations (FL, FLOOR)

### 2. Extreme Value Correction
Identified and corrected impossible property values using hierarchical fallback strategy:

**Criteria for Extreme Values**:
- Bedrooms = 0 or > 10
- Bathrooms = 0 or > 8
- Impossible ratios (e.g., 8 bedrooms with 1 bathroom)
- Size mismatches (< 100 or > 5,000 sq ft per bedroom)

**Correction Methods** (in order):
1. Same street + home type median (min 5 properties)
2. Same zipcode + home type median (min 10 properties)
3. Same zipcode median (min 5 properties)
4. Living area estimation (800 sq ft/bedroom, 500 sq ft/bathroom)
5. Dataset-wide median (last resort)

### 3. Price Cleaning
Removed properties with:
- Zero prices
- Price < $50 per sq ft (unrealistic for NYC)
- Prices < $50,000 or > $20,000,000 (outliers)

**Removed**: 311 properties (1.7%)

## üîß Feature Engineering

### Street-Level Features
- **Prestigious Streets**: 5th Ave, Park Ave, Central Park W/S, Broadway, Wall St, Madison Ave
- **Street Types**: Avenue, Street, Drive, Boulevard, Circle, Place, Road, Lane, Court, Terrace
- **Direction Indicators**: East, West, North, South prefixes
- **Street Numbers**: Extracted numeric components (e.g., "5th" ‚Üí 5)

### Geographic Features
- **Manhattan Grid Zones**:
  - Lower Manhattan (< 14th St) - Financial District
  - Midtown (34th - 59th St) - Commercial hub
  - Upper Manhattan (> 59th St) - Residential areas
- **Zipcode Patterns**: First digit, first two digits

### Interaction Features
Created 40+ interaction terms between:

- **Test Set**: 3,574 properties (20%)

### Model Comparison

![Model Comparison](models_comparison.png)

| Model | MAPE (%) | RMSE | R¬≤ Score |
|-------|----------|------|----------|
| **LightGBM** ‚≠ê | **30.72** | **989,980** | **0.7992** |
| CatBoost | 32.11 | 1,032,960 | 0.7814 |
| ExtraTrees | 30.94 | 1,183,564 | 0.7130 |

### Why LightGBM Was Chosen for Deployment

LightGBM was selected as the production model based on:
1. **Best Overall Performance**: Lowest RMSE and highest R¬≤ score on test data
2. **Balanced Metrics**: Strong performance across MAPE, RMSE, and R¬≤ 
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Faster inference time compared to CatBoost and ExtraTrees
4. **Robust Predictions**: Better generalization with ~20% improvement in RMSE over ExtraTrees

## üìà Model Evaluation - LightGBM

### Residuals vs Predicted
![LGBM Residuals vs Predicted](lgbm_residuals_vs_predicted.png)

The residuals plot shows relatively random scatter around zero, indicating:
- ‚úÖ Good model fit with no systematic bias
- ‚úÖ Homoscedasticity (constant variance) across prediction ranges
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some outliers present at higher price points (luxury properties)

### Residuals Distribution
![LGBM Residuals Distribution](lgbm_residuals_distribution.png)

The distribution of residuals demonstrates:
- ‚úÖ Approximately normal distribution centered at zero
- ‚úÖ Symmetric spread indicating unbiased predictions
- ‚úÖ Most predictions within reasonable error bounds

### Q-Q Plot
![LGBM Q-Q Plot](lgbm_qq_plot.png)

The Q-Q plot reveals:
- ‚úÖ Strong adherence to normality in the central quantiles
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Heavy tails on both ends (common in real estate data)
- üí° Tail deviations suggest extreme properties (very cheap/expensive) are harder to predict

### Interpretation
The model performs well on typical NYC properties but shows prediction challenges for:
- Ultra-luxury properties (> $10M)
- Unique architectural properties
- Properties with uncommon feature combinations

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn lightgbm catboost scipy matplotlib seaborn joblib
```

### Running the Models
```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd

# Load the best model (LightGBM)
with open('model/lgbm/lgbm_model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Load label encoders
from joblib import load
borough_encoder = load('embedding/borough_label_encoder.pkl')
home_type_encoder = load('embedding/home_type_label_encoder.pkl')

# Make predictions
# (Prepare your features according to the feature engineering pipeline)
prediction = model.predict(X_new)
```

## üéØ Key Insights

1. **Location Dominates**: Zipcode and street characteristics are the strongest predictors
2. **Property Size Matters**: Living area interactions capture size-quality relationships
3. **Street Type Impact**: Avenue properties consistently command premium prices
4. **Manhattan Grid**: East/West designation significantly affects pricing
5. **Model Choice**: LightGBM's gradient boosting provides optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency
6. **Outlier Challenge**: Extreme properties (both high and low end) remain difficult to predict accurately

## üìä Model Reliability

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Accurate predictions for 70% of properties (within 30% error)
- ‚úÖ Reliable for standard residential properties
- ‚úÖ Good generalization across all NYC boroughs

**Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher error for luxury properties (> $5M)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Reduced accuracy for rare property types
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporal price changes not captured (static snapshot)

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- [ ] Include proximity to subway stations
- [ ] Incorporate school district ratings
- [ ] Add crime statistics by neighborhood
- [ ] Implement neural network models
- [ ] Add explainability with SHAP values
